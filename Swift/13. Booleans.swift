/*
    ðŸ”´ Booleans
    
        Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool.
        Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.

        âœ… Swift provides two Boolean constant values, true and false:

            let orangesAreOrange: Bool = true
            let turnipsAreDelicious: Bool = false

        âœ… Boolean values are particularly useful when you work with conditional statements such as the if statement:

            if turnipsAreDelicious {
                print("Mmm, tasty turnips!")
            } else {
                print("Eww, turnips are horrible.")
            }

            if i == 1 {
            }
